# SaTreeLight - Data processing notebook

Continuation of [SaTreeLight - data-processing](https://github.com/SaTreeLight/data-processing).

New version based around the sentinelsat python package. This is due to free access to [copernicus scihub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home) with one-time registering, instead of the limited free use with sentinelhub. Fetching old stuff from long term storage takes time though.

## Setup

Be sure to make a [credentials](credentials_example) file from the example with your copernicus username and password.

## Future

Might swap to the new [Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/).
